## Sawteeth noise generator

### Project and makefile included above

#### This project includes the external sawteeth, a pd external that generates a sawtooth using table lookup, along with an all-pass filter tailored to low-pass, as well as a bitcrusher. All are controlled by inlets, with the help patch describing how to use the external.
